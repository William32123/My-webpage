      <h1>What is Basketball?</h1>
      
        <p>Basketball is a game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent's goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket. In order to play a proper basketball game, there needs to be two teams and each teams needs to have five players on the court. There are usually four quarters, each one lasting 12 minutes long. There is usualy a referee who makes any calls that needs to be made and to make sure that the game is being played fairly. By the end of the game, whichever team scored the most amount of points wins. If the score is tied, then there will be overtime. Overtime is when an additional five minutes is added to the clock so that there may be a team that is declared as the winners.</p>

    <h1>Creation of Basketball</h1>

    <p>For those of you who don't know, basketball was invented by a Canadian man 131 years ago. The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented by James Naismith (1861–1939) on or about December 1, 1891, at the International Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School (now Springfield College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education.</p>

    <h1>History of Basketball</h1>

    <p>For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two half-bushel peach baskets, which gave the sport its name. The students were enthusiastic. After much running and shooting, William R. Chase made a midcourt shot—the only score in that historic contest. Word spread about the newly invented game, and numerous associations wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules, which were published in the January 15, 1892, issue of the Triangle, the YMCA Training School’s campus paper.</p>

    <p>In 1893, James Naismith changed the peach baskets to iron hoops and a hammock style basket. This made getting the ball a lot easier as someone didn't have to constantly keep climbing up to get the ball down from the basket.
