      <h1>NBA Top 75 List</h1>

      <p>Over the years, there have been a very significant number of players who have impacted the game and who have changed the game. It would be pretty difficult to keep track of ALL the players, so, a top 75 list was made.
        <!--"The NBA 75th anniversary team was selected by a panel of media members, current and former players, coaches and team executives". That was a definition from google--> 
         This list consits of the top 75 players in NBA History. Some will say that it is accurate and others will say that it isn't what it should be.</p>
         <!--Personally, I don't think that the list is very accurate as a number of very respectable players were left out of this list. At the end of the day it all comes back to personal opinions and everyone has their own-->

      <h1>2 of the Best Players</h1>

      <h2>Michael Jordan</h2>
      
      <p>No matter whether you were born in the 1970's or the 2000's, when someone mentions the name Michael Jordan, you instantly know who they are talking about. Michael Jordan has impacted the game in a very big way. He has led his team (the Chicago Bulls) to the finals 6 times and has won all 6 Championships. This was done in the span of 8 years! Talk about impressive. For all six championships, they were won as three-peats! If you don't know, a three-peat is whe you win back-to-back-to-back titles. To win a three-peat once is a very big accomplishment, but to do it twice in 8 years is just next to amazing. Some people may argue that he my be the best man to have ever played the sport, but one thing is for certain, when he was playing, he was the best of the best.</p>

      <h2>LeBron James</h2>

      <p>Ever since his days in high school, he has been well known for his electric skill of basketball. Today, he is the most well known basketball player who is still active. LeBron James has impacted the game of basketball in a very big way and is a very respected basketball player and man. He is very skilled and talented and he is also a leader. He is a team player and knows how to involve his teammates in the game. So far he has won four championships and is still one of the best players 19 years into his NBA career at the age of 37 years old! Talk about longevity.</p> 
        <!--Some people say that Lebron is better than Jordan and vice versa. The way I see it, Michael Jordan revolutionized the way that the game of basketball is being played but Lebron is looking like he is the best to play the game. However, Michael had the better career. If you asked me, I would say Michael>Lebron; but that is just my opinion-->
